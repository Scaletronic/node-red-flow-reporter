    Do not edit the files in this folder. They are generated by the node-red-flow-reporter.

    The files should be updated every time the flow is updated.

    The purpose is to be able to do a proper text compare of the flow files.    
  
    The file names are constructed from the node type and the headline of the content.

    i.e. ui_template-format_Process_Monitor.html

    Node type: ui_template
    Node Name: Process Monitor
    Property (Headline in table): format
    File type: html

    If there is no node name, the  the node id is used instead.
